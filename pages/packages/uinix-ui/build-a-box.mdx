> **Note:** This document provides examples written in [React].  The examples can be similarly implemented with any [hyperscript]-based view library.  For further reading, please refer to the `uinix-ui` package for API documentation.

## `Box`

The `Box` component is [popularized][theme-ui-box] by libraries such as [rebass] and [theme-ui].  It serves as a primitive component to build other components in UI systems.  We will use `uinix-ui` to implement `Box`, supporting the following [theme-ui]-inspired features:
- Shorthand style props: (i.e. the `bg`, `color`, `m`, `mt`, `mr`, `mb`, `ml`, `mx`, `my`, `p`, `pt`, `pr`, `pb`, `pl`, `px`, `py` props)
- Themeable styles (i.e. the `sx` prop)
- Transclusion (i.e. the `as` prop)

## Configure the System

To support [shorthand style props][theme-ui-shorthand-style-props], let us first configure them for the `uinix-ui` `Element` component.

```js
const config = {
  elementShorthandPropsMapping: {
    backgroundColor: ['bg'],
    color: ['color'],
    margin: ['m'],
    marginBottom: ['mb', 'my', 'm'],
    marginLeft: ['ml', 'mx', 'm'],
    marginRight: ['mr', 'mx', 'm'],
    marginTop: ['mt', 'my', 'm'],
    padding: ['p'],
    paddingBottom: ['pb', 'py', 'p'],
    paddingLeft: ['pl', 'px', 'p'],
    paddingRight: ['pr', 'px', 'p'],
    paddingTop: ['pt', 'py', 'p'],
  },
};
```

> **Note:** We can further configure other shorthand props by simply defining them in `config.elementShorthandPropsMapping`.  One may find this useful to implement other shorthand props that were previously provided by [rebass] (e.g. `height`, `width`), or to simply define new style props that fit your needs.  `uinix-ui` allows this to be fully configurable.

## Load the System

Let us create an example `theme` and load the system so we can test as we develop `Box`.

```js
import {createElement as h} from 'react';
import {load} from 'uinix-ui';

import config from './config.js'; // the config we created previously

const system = {
  theme: { // create a simple theme to test shorthand props
    colors: {
      brand: {
        primary: '#abc'
      },
    },
    spacings: {
      s: '8px',
      m: '16px'
      l: '32px'
    },
  },
},

load({config, h, system});
```

## Verify Features

After `load`ing our configuration and system, the `Element` component is now configured based on our needs.

### Shorthand style props

Let us verify that shorthand style props work as expected with an example:

```js
import {Element} from 'uinix-ui';

const Example = () => {
  return (
    <Element
      bg="brand.primary"
      color="pink"
      mx="auto"
      my="0"
      p="m"
      pl="l">
      Element
    </Element>
  );
}
```

Our example should render with the following CSS:

```css
.rendered {
  background-color: #abc;
  color: pink;
  margin-top: 0;
  margin-right: auto;
  margin-bottom: 0;
  margin-left: auto;
  padding-top: 16px;
  padding-right: 16px;
  padding-bottom: 16px;
  padding-left: 32px;
}
```

### Transclusion

`Element` supports the `as` prop and we can easily verify with an example.

```js
import {Element} from 'uinix-ui';

const Example = () => {
  return (
    <Element as="button" onClick={() => alert('clicked')}>
      Should render as a HTMLButtonElement
    </Element>
  );
}
```

### Themeable Styles

`Element` supports the `styles` prop which allows specifying themeable styles, similar to [theme-ui]'s [`sx`][theme-ui-sx-prop] prop.  The `styles` prop has a few additional powerful features of supporting style composition when specified as an array of styles.

```js
import {Element} from 'uinix-ui';

const Example = () => {
  const spacingStyle = {
    margin: 'm',
    padding: 'l',
  };
  const colorStyle = {
    backgroundColor: 'brand.primary',
    ':hover': {
      backgroundColor: 'pink',
    },
  };

  return (
    <Element styles={[spacingStyle, colorStyle]}>
      Button
    </Element>
  );
}
```

Our example should render with the following CSS:

```css
.rendered {
  background-color: #abc;
  margin: 16px;
  padding: 32px;
}
.rendered:hover {
  background-color: pink;
}
```

## `Element === Box`

At this point, we observe that all required `Box` features are actually already supported by `Element`, and we can use `Element` interchangeably with `Box`.

You may choose to re-export `Element` as `Box` in your app if you prefer to associate the component using the `Box` name.

```js
export {Element as Box} from 'uinix-ui';
```

If you are intending to migrate from [theme-ui], you may find it convenient to formalize a simple implementation of `Box` to facilitate refactoring.

```js
import {Element} from 'uinix-ui';

export const Box = ({sx, ...rest}) => {
  return <Element {...rest} styles={sx} />
};
```

## Further Style Customizations

In addition to configuring `Box` with [Â§ Shorthand style props](#shorthand-style-props), `uinix-ui` provides further style customizations for `Box` via `config.elementStyles`.

Say we would like to enforce the following shared style behaviors for `Box` (and subsequently any components built with `Box`):
- When `disabled`, disable pointer events and render a `'not-allowed'` cursor.
- When clickable, render a `'pointer'` cursor and an opacity hover effect.
- When `active`, render a blue background and white text.

We will define the following *style functions* in `config.elementStyles`:

```js
const styles = { // this maybe organized in another shared file
  active: ({active}) => active ? {
    backgroundColor: 'blue',
    color: 'white',
  } : null,
  clickable: ({onClick}) => onClick ? {
    cursor: 'pointer',
    opacity: 1,
    ':hover': {
      opacity: '0.7'
    },
  } : null,
  disabled: ({disabled}) => disabled ? {
    cursor: 'not-allowed',
    pointerEvents: 'none',
  } : null,
};

const config = {
  elementShorthandPropsMapping: {...}; // defined in previous section,
  elementStyles: [
    styles.active,
    styles.clickable,
    styles.disabled,
  ],
};
```

[Â§ Load the System](#load-the-system) appropriately, and test with the following examples to confirm that `Box` and any components built with `Box` should enjoy the same shared styles.

```js
import {Element, Text} from 'uinix-ui';

const Example = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <Element disabled>
        Renders as a HTMLDivElement with a 'not-allowed' cursor.
      </Element>
      <Element as="button" disabled>
        Renders as a HTMLButtonElement with a 'not-allowed' cursor.
      </Element>
      <Element as="button" active>
        Renders as a HTMLButtonElement with the specified active style
      </Element>
      <Text disabled active>
        Renders with the specified disabled and active styles on a
        non-Element component that is composed from Element.
      </Text>
      <Text onClick={() => alert('clicked')}>
        Renders with the specified clickable style.
      </Text>
    </div>
  );
}
```

> **Note:** `config.elementStyles` is a very powerful way to share common props-driven styles defined on `Element` and all components built with `Element`.  It is recommended to be use caution when making these design decisions as they may have unintended effects on downstream components.  A good rule of thumb is to use this powerful feature sparingly, and keep things simple!

## Conclusion

In this guide, we covered building a `Box` component with `uinix-ui`.  Not only were we able to quickly implement popular features from libraries such as [theme-ui], we also explored that `uinix-ui`'s `Element` component behaves essentially as a configurable `Box` component.
