## Overview

[hyperscript] supports a [DSL] to easily and idiomatically create a tree of nodes.  It popularizes the `h` (also known as `createElement`) method which usually has the following signature:

`h(nodeName, attributes, [children])`
- A required [node name].
- An object containing attributes for the node.
- An optional array of children which can take the following values:
  - Scalar values (string, number, boolean, null, undefined)
  - Elements created via `h`.
  - Recurisvely nested arrays of the above.

Using `h`, it is simple to create a tree of nodes.  For example,

```js
const tree = h(
  'blockquote',
  {
    id: 'test',
    className: 'demo'
  }, [
    'This is a blockquote with some '
    h('strong', {}, 'strong'),
    ' content'
  ],
);
```

will create the following DOM tree:

```html
<blockquote id="test" class="demo">
  This is a blockquote with some <strong>strong</strong> content.
</blockquote>
```

## [hyperscript]-based Libraries

The `h` pattern is supported in many view libraries.  Some popular libraries are listed below:
- [hyperscript]
- [react]
- [preact]
- [vue]
- [svelte]
- [solid]
- [mithril]
- [htm]
- [virtual-dom]

## uinix-ui

Please refer to **ยง Frameworks** in `uinix-ui` on how to use **uinix-ui** in the respective [hyperscript]-based libraries.

**uinix-ui** supports any [hyperscript]-based view library.  This is specified at a single instance when loading your system.

```js
import {createElement as h} from 'react';
import {load} from 'uinix-ui';

const config = {...};
const system = {...};

// specify the h method when loading your system.
load({h, config, system});
```

Building components will now use the specified/loaded `h` method.

## Caveats

[hyperscript] has a huge and vibrant ecosystem, but there is [no official or standardized API][hyperscript-issue-66].  This means that its implementation varies with different providers.  For example [React]'s `createElement` differs from [Mithril]'s `m` which differs from [Vue]'s `h` and so on.

When using with `uinix-ui`, we assume the interface mentioned in [ยง Overview](#overview).

## Conclusion

In this short guide, we covered [hyperscript] and view libraries utilizing [hyperscript].  We explored how `uinix-ui` leverages [hyperscript] to support building UI components and systems in framework-agnostic ways.
