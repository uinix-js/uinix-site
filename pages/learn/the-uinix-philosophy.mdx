## Principles

The uinix philosophy borrows spiritually from the [Unix philosophy], with contextual adjustments for UI development.

### Minimal

APIs are minimal but solves a wide range of UI problems effectively when used appropriately.

> Do more with less.

### Configurable

APIs support reasonable configurations and avoid opinionated decisions.

> Your code, your rules ðŸ¤˜.

### JS-first

Solve the domain problem in JS and not in specific frameworks.

> APIs are usable without frameworks or build systems (e.g. directly in browsers).

### Stable

APIs are intended to be stable, dependency-light, and update-free.

> This builds confidence for both APIs maintainers and consumers.
