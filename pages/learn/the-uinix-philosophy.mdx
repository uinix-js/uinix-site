## Principles

All `uinix-js` packages are built with the `uinix` philosophy in mind.  The `uinix` philosophy borrows spiritually from the [Unix philosophy], with contextual adjustments for UI development.

### Functional
APIs are functional (practical) for common UI development needs.

> Make it work, make it right, make it fast.

### Minimal
APIs are simple and clear, and reduced to a minimal.

> Do one thing, and do it well.

### Configurable
APIs support reasonable configurations and avoid opinionated decisions.

> Your code, your rules ðŸ¤˜.

### Stable
APIs are well-defined and focus on core offerings.  Advanced use cases are deferred to implementors through configuration or recommended with presets.

> Develop with confidence without the stress of keeping up.

### JS-first
APIs are written in simple plain JS.  No build/tools/frameworks required.

> We confidently state that any framework is ephemeral, and only JS is the safe foundation to develop on.
